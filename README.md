```

## For computers running Windows

```

Where compiled_code is the name of the folder that includes all the compiled C++ programs and co_name is the compiled name of cw_code.cpp
The code_folder is the folder that includes the currently working C++ code (cw_code).
To execute the compiled C++ code, you must type in the command
